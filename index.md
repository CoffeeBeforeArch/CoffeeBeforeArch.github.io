## CoffeeBeforeArch - The Github Page

Hey everyone I'm Nick, and welcome to the CoffeeBeforeArch GitHub page! I'm creating 100% open teaching content on a variety of topics, including introductory C++ programming, performance optimization and benchmarking, and GPU architecture.

The content I create reflects how I would have wanted to learn about programming, optimization, and architecture. Hopefully it helps others that are teaching themselves about computer science like I did.

## Setup

A few people have been curious about my software/hardware setup. I've therefore provided a list of these things below, with a brief rational behind the choices.

### Software
#### Operating System - Ubuntu 18.04
If you're looking to try a GNU-Linux operating system, Ubuntu is a great place to start. It was the first distribution that I used, and supports all the software I need. There are more do-it-yourself distrubutions (like Arch), but I've never needed that level of customization.

#### Text Editor - VIM
I use VIM because it was the first text editor introduced to me. I have no ill will against people that use Emacs, Atom, etc., because it's a pointless debate. Use whatever you're comfortable with.

I use the [amix vimrc](https://github.com/amix/vimrc). It is incredibly easy to install, and contains almost every plugin you could want. The single modification I have made to this configuration is the addition of the [ClangFormat plugin](https://github.com/rhysd/vim-clang-format). [ClangFormat](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) is a great tool for automatically formatting code. Personally, I use the Google C++ style. I have modified my .vimrc file to bind a function key to automatically run ClangFormat.
