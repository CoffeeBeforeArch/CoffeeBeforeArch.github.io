## CoffeeBeforeArch - The Github Page

Hey everyone I'm Nick, and welcome to the CoffeeBeforeArch GitHub page! I'm creating 100% open teaching content on a variety of topics, including introductory C++ programming, performance optimization and benchmarking, and GPU architecture.

The content I create reflects how I would have wanted to learn about programming, optimization, and architecture. Hopefully it helps others that are teaching themselves about computer science like I did.
