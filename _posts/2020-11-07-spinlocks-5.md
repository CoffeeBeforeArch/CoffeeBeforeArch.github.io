# Spinlocks - Part 5

In the [last blog post](https://coffeebeforearch.github.io/2020/11/07/spinlocks-5.html), we used the passive backoff optimization to reduce the power consumption of our spinlock. However, we don't always want our threads pause for constant amount of time.

In this blog post, we'll look at two spinlocks that use a non-constant form of backoff (exponential and random).

## Our Benchmark

We will evaluate our spinlock implementations using [Google Benchmark](https://github.com/google/benchmark). The structure of the benchmark can be found below:

```cpp
 // Small Benchmark
 static void bench(benchmark::State &s) {
   // Sweep over a range of threads
   auto num_threads = s.range(0);
 
   // Value we will increment
   std::int64_t val = 0;
 
   // Allocate a vector of threads
   std::vector<std::thread> threads;
   threads.reserve(num_threads);
 
   Spinlock sl;
 
   // Timing loop
   for (auto _ : s) {
     for (auto i = 0u; i < num_threads; i++) {
       threads.emplace_back([&] { inc(sl, val); });
     }
     // Join threads
     for (auto &thread : threads) thread.join();
     threads.clear();
   }
 }
 BENCHMARK(bench)
     ->RangeMultiplier(2)
     ->Range(1, std::thread::hardware_concurrency())
     ->UseRealTime()
     ->Unit(benchmark::kMillisecond);
```

We'll be evaluating our benchmark for a power-of-two number of threads (1, 2, 4, and 8 on my machine), where each thread runs a function called `inc`. This function can be found below:

```cpp
 // Increment val once each time the lock is acquired
 void inc(Spinlock &s, std::int64_t &val) {
   for (int i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {
     s.lock();
     val++;
     s.unlock();
   }
 }
```

For 100k iterations, our threads try and lock our spinlock, increment a shared value, then release the lock. This gives us a heavy contention scenario in which to test our spinlock.
